# VB-DieRoller
A simple die roller made in VB

I was bored and it had been awhile since I made a VB Project. So I figured I'd toss this together. I'm a big D&D fan, and I like to combime D&D and coding just because they really work well together. 
Feel free to make commit suggestions of fork this. I may also make a C# version of this project. Or make alternate versions using WPF. Once I get more comfortable with Electron that would be a fun one. I intend to make
more D&D related projects in the future including character sheets and stat block generators. Glad to be making open source applications, even if some of these will be on the simpler side!!!
